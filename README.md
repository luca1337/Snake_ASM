# Snake_ASM
- **This is a simple version of the classic Snake game written using cc65 Assembly**
- **The intention was just to write some code and mastering with Assembly programming :P and not to violate any copyright**
- **It's just an educational and academic project that i worked on during my last year, not all part of code are well commented, but i think it's easy to understand :)**
